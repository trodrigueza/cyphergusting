Implementing some classic Cryptosistems.

Run `examples/cipher_eg` for example.

Considerations:
- You can use the library in python: `build\cipher.so`. In `examples/main.py` it is imported from `../build`.
- `CMakeLists.txt` is for building `build\cipher.so`.

Types supported:
- Caesar.
- Substitution.
- Affine.
- Vigenere.
